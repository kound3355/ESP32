Hello everyone, this is the code for checking the weather condition using ESP32 with PMS5003 and AM2301 sensors. Before you use it, please download the following extensions:

1. DHT
2. PMS

The principle of this program is to connect via the Wi-Fi we set up and send data through MQTT. Alternatively, you can use Node-RED. Data will be sent every 3 seconds. I hope you all like it. Thank you!
